# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

parameters:

services:
    App\Twig\AppExtension:
        tags: ['twig.extension']
        
    App\Service\Plugin\PluginService:
        class: App\Service\Plugin\PluginService
        public: true


    App\Service\TestService:
        class: App\Service\TestService
        public: true

        
    # ! you should implement the plugin service alias in Services.yaml using its name by the following steps:
    # ! use snake_case
    # ! Concatenate the plugin name with _service
    # ! replace the spaces with _
    # ? Example:
    # ? if the plugin name is hubspot
    # ? the service alias should be hubspot_service
    # ? if the plugin name is google analytics
    # ? the service alias should be google_analytics_service
         
    # Aliases for services
    test_service:
        alias: App\Service\TestService
        public: true

    plugin_service: 
        alias: App\Service\Plugin\PluginService
        public: true



    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.


    # ! this line is important to make the container available in the service
    Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface: '@service_container'
    
    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
    App\:
        resource: '../src/'
        exclude:
            - '../src/DependencyInjection/'
            - '../src/Entity/'
            - '../src/Kernel.php'

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
    # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
